# Password Generator

## Description

The goal of this project was to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This web application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

- When user clicks the button to generate a password, they presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
- When prompted for the length of the password, they can input a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
- Application checks if valid number between 8 and 128 was entered and alerts user if input doesn't match the criteria to try again. 
- User then confirms whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
- User required to select at least one type of characters and if they don't meet the criteria, app alerts the user and offers to try again.  
- To ensure at least on of each characters would be present in the password, as user confirms criteria, random character from that set is being added to the password. 
- When the password is generated, it is displayed on the page inside of the text box.
